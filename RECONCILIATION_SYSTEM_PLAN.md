# Reconciliation System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Moving reconciliation system from dashboard component to dedicated Tools section with flexible date ranges and separate fuel/tank reconciliation workflows.

## Navigation Structure
**Current**: Dashboard | Fuel Entry | Summary (3 buttons)
**New**: Dashboard | Fuel Entry | Summary | **Tools** (4 buttons)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Navigation & Structure ‚úÖ
- [x] Create Tools navigation button (‚öôÔ∏è icon)
- [x] Build `/tools` landing page with grid cards
- [x] Create `/tools/reconciliations` page shell
- [x] Move existing reconciliation component
- [x] Move database page to `/tools/database`

### Phase 2: Enhanced Date System
- [ ] Build date range picker component
- [ ] Add preset buttons (Today, Last 7 Days, This Week, This Month, Custom)
- [ ] Update backend API for flexible date ranges
- [ ] Database migration: monthly_reconciliations ‚Üí fuel_reconciliations

### Phase 3: Separate Reconciliation Types
- [ ] Split fuel vs tank reconciliation UI
- [ ] Create separate API endpoints
- [ ] Build reconciliation history view
- [ ] Add confidence scoring

### Phase 4: Editing Interfaces ‚úÖ
- [x] Build inline fuel entry editor with individual and bulk editing
- [x] Create tank level adjustment tools with quick adjust features  
- [x] Add validation and warnings for all adjustment operations
- [x] Bulk operations for corrections (add/subtract/multiply)
- [x] Audit logging for tank adjustments

### Phase 5: Polish & Integration
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness refinement
- [ ] System settings framework
- [ ] Advanced reporting foundation

## Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Rename and enhance
ALTER TABLE monthly_reconciliations RENAME TO fuel_reconciliations;
ALTER TABLE fuel_reconciliations 
  ADD COLUMN start_date DATE,
  ADD COLUMN end_date DATE,
  DROP COLUMN month;

-- New indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_fuel_reconciliations_date_range ON fuel_reconciliations(start_date, end_date);
```

## Page Structure

### /tools (Landing Page)
Grid layout with cards:
- Reconciliations
- Database Management (comprehensive fleet/entity management)
- System Settings (future)
- Advanced Reports (future)

### /tools/reconciliations (Main Feature)
- Date range selector with presets
- Split sections: Fuel Reconciliation | Tank Reconciliation
- Separate reconcile buttons for each type
- Reconciliation history below
- Editing interfaces accessible from each section

## Key Features
- **Flexible date ranges**: Any period, not just monthly
- **Separate reconciliation types**: Fuel usage vs tank levels
- **Editing capabilities**: Fix entries and readings inline
- **Historical tracking**: View past reconciliations
- **Mobile-first design**: Minimal, clean, compact

## Technical Notes
- Tank reconciliation uses end date of selected range
- Weekly presets as primary use case
- Real-time data preview as date ranges change
- Tank capacity: 24,000L for percentage calculations
- Bowser difference: End - Start (readings increase)
