## ✅ Phase 1 Complete: SARS Compliance & Core Usability (January 2025)

### 1. ✅ Zone-Based Location System (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Some operations (road maintenance, transport, general farm work) don't occur in specific fields
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added "zones" as an alternative to fields (6 default zones: A1-North, A2-Northeast, B1-East, B2-South, C1-West, C2-Central)
- ✅ Created zone management interface in fleet section
- ✅ Updated fuel entry workflow to show both fields and zones
- ✅ Generated printable zone map for fuel station wall
- ✅ SARS-compliant location tracking for all operations

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- ✅ COMPLETED: Added zones table
CREATE TABLE zones (
  id, code, name, description, 
  zone_type, coordinates, color, display_order, active
);

-- ✅ COMPLETED: Updated fuel_entries with check constraint
ALTER TABLE fuel_entries ADD zone_id REFERENCES zones(id);
ALTER TABLE fuel_entries ADD CONSTRAINT location_check 
  CHECK ((field_id IS NOT NULL) != (zone_id IS NOT NULL));
```

### 2. ✅ Fuel Attendant Summary View (COMPLETED)
**Purpose**: Quick reference for manual book transcription (SARS backup)
**Route**: `/fuel/summary`

**Features**:
- ✅ Mobile-optimized table showing today's entries with field/zone locations
- ✅ Grouped by vehicle for easy transcription  
- ✅ Print-friendly CSS for physical backup
- ✅ CSV export functionality for record keeping
- ✅ Real-time updates with 30-second auto-refresh
- ✅ Navigation integrated in both desktop and mobile layouts

## 🚀 Next Phase: Enhanced Features & Analytics

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Activity Descriptions Refinement (Priority: HIGH)
**Requirement**: SARS compliance requires specific, unambiguous activity descriptions
**Current State**: Basic activity names (e.g., "Ploughing", "Transport", "Spraying")
**Target**: Detailed, SARS-compliant descriptions
**Actions**:
- Review all 22 activities for SARS clarity requirements
- Add detailed descriptions that specify exact operations
- Examples:
  - "Ploughing" → "Field ploughing - soil preparation"
  - "Transport" → "Crop transport - field to storage" 
  - "Spraying" → "Herbicide application - weed control"
  - "Maintenance" → "Equipment maintenance - on-site repairs"

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
**Target**: Improve workflow efficiency and user satisfaction
- **Success Modal**: ✅ COMPLETED - Cleaned up success feedback (1.5s delay)
- **Location Display**: ✅ COMPLETED - Show field/zone in review step
- **Auto-refresh Optimization**: Consider reducing from 30s to 15s
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add quick entry shortcuts for power users
- **Dark Mode**: Optional dark theme for night operations

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Development Best Practices
**Always follow SvelteKit and Svelte 5 conventions:**
- Use `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` runes instead of legacy stores where appropriate
- Use `browser` check for client-only code to prevent SSR hydration mismatches
- Use `+page.ts` and `+layout.ts` for data loading when possible
- Prefer SvelteKit's built-in form actions over manual form handling
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Follow component composition patterns over prop drilling

### Development Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd farmtrack-sveltekit

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
